notifies a Discord Channel when service is down and when it comes back online.

## How to run:

1. Install dependencies using `npm install`;
2. Insert your Discord bot token, URL/IP address of your server and MONGO connection URL
in the .env file;
3. Run the bot by using `npm start`;

## Making changes:

Feel free to change anything you may want in the bot. 

You can also run a development server that restarts the bot on any change by
using `npm run dev`.
